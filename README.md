# Blog-preview-page
This is a website of a blog page. I found inspiration on Frontend Mentor , I could not access the main designs so worked around it and I used my designs but the background is similar to the original one in Frontend Mentor. 
The images are taken directly from the web, and they are not locally downloaded.
